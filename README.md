## General Information
### Project Information
This project aims to develop a predictive model for bike sharing demand in the United States to assist BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing company, in recovering from the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. By gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing bike sharing demand, BoomBikes can make data-driven decisions to optimize its operations, allocate resources effectively, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Project Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the bike-sharing industry, leading to decreased demand and revenue for many providers. BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing company, is facing challenges in sustaining its business amidst the ongoing crisis.

To recover and thrive in the post-pandemic era, BoomBikes aims to understand the factors influencing bike sharing demand and develop a predictive model to anticipate future trends. This will enable them to optimize their operations, allocate resources effectively, and meet customer needs more efficiently.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
* How well those variables describe the bike demands?

### Business Problem:
The primary business problem is to accurately predict bike sharing demand in the US market. By understanding the factors that drive demand, BoomBikes can:

* Optimize bike distribution and availability.
* Improve pricing strategies.
* Enhance marketing campaigns.
* Make informed business decisions for expansion and growth.

### Dataset
The dataset is the csv file provided which has data for the years 2018 to 2019. 

## Conclusions
* **Temperature (temp)** The most significant predictor, with a positive coefficient, indicating a strong positive relationship with bike  sharing demand.
* **Weather conditions** A significant negative predictor, suggesting that the weather condition has a negative impact on bike sharing demand.
* **Year (yr)** A positive predictor, indicating a trend of increasing bike sharing demand over time.
* **Humidity (hum)** A negative predictor, suggesting that higher humidity levels might decrease bike sharing demand.
* **Windspeed** A negative predictor suggests a negative relationship between windspeed and bike sharing demand.
* **Seasonal and Monthly factors** Seasonal and monthly factors have both positive and negative effects on bike sharing demand.
